          <p>During the pandemic months, I’ve turned to tactile crafts, learning to knit with my arms as needles and printing with cyanotype chemicals. I looked into those iron-together, mosaic beads meant for kids. Given a grid and physical pixels in ordered spectrums of colors, I thought it’d be natural to render some data.</p>
          <p>This is a sort of companion piece to the <a href="https://cotterjk.github.io/plaster-creek/">hourly streamflow visualizer</a>—low-tech vs. high, manual depiction vs. automated, and a three-year daily history vs. hourly updates.</p>
          <h2>Data Proces</h2>
          <p>In addition to hourly measurements, the <a href"https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/uv/?site_no=04119055">USGS Plaster Creek site</a> calculates an average discharge for each day, and puts those in a table to summarize each water year. (A “water year” begins each October to account for early snowfall that doesn’t melt until spring.)</p>

            <p>I scraped these into a Google Sheet and used conditional formatting to shade each cell blue by value.</p>

            <p>This is really the heatmap I was after, but I need another step to help me make it a physical object. I took a screenshot, and in Photoshop, used the posterize effect to quantize or “round” the continuous color scale up or down to five shades of blue available in <a href="https://www.perler.com/perler-storefront-catalog/products/tropical-bead-tray_80-17549--perler-beads/">Perler’s “Tropical” bead tray line: Robin's Egg, Mist, Lagoon, Teal, and Midnight</a>! This became my key as I lay beads. It probably took three soothing hours total.</p>
            <h2>Note on units</h2>
            <p>I actually skipped a step above: in the spreadsheet, I first converted each measurement to its value <em>log<sub>2</sub></em>. I created this heatmap actually using that value instead, so that color variation communicates a truer seasonal arc.</p>

            <p>The streamflow gauge is capable of answering the question: every second, how many cubes of water, a foot in each dimension, are fully displaced from their position here? When streamflow increases basically at all, the answer to this question surges exponentially. The USGS site uses a logarithmic scale by default for this ft<sup>3</sup>/sec unit. So I straightened out that curve, rescaling the high variation in large readings to the low variation in small readings. The scale in the bottom corner makes this plain.</p>

            <p>(I log’d the discharge reading on my <a href="https://cotterjk.github.io/plaster-creek/">hourly update page</a> as well, calculating the height of the blue wave. Little fluctuations on dry days then have as much visible range as big flood fluctuations do.)</p>

            <p>(The USGS station started collecting water height in April 2020. This unit increases more linearly with rainfall and probably my subjective sensation of streamflow, though it doesn’t capture speed.)</p>

            <p>Anyway, this is all to say: logarithmic scales can be really hard to make sense of, and can require some reinterpretation, which sometimes feels like data manipulation. Numbers feel so objective; attaching a unit to them grounds them in the real world, though still abstractly enough to require interpretation. I think this communication is a main concern of data visualization practice.</p>
